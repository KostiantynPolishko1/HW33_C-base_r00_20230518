# HW33_C++base_r00_20230518

Task1
Implement a function that takes a vector of integers and returns a new vector, 
containing only prime numbers from the original vector.
Task2
Write a program that asks the user for the size of a vector
and then fills it with random numbers from 1 to 100.
Sort the vector in descending order and display the sorted vector on the screen.

Task3
Implement a function that takes two vectors of integers and returns a new vector,
containing elements that are only present in one of the vectors(excluding common elements).

Task4
Write a program that asks the user for the size of the vector and then fills it with values. 
The program should then remove any repeating elements from the vectorand display the updated vector.

Task5
Implement a function that takes a vector of stringsand returns a new vector,
containing only strings that start with a certain substring(specified by the user).

Task6
Write a program that asks the user for two vectors of numbers of the same size.
Multiply the corresponding elements from each vectorand display the result.

Task7
Implement a function that takes a vector of numbersand returns a new vector,
containing only numbers that are squares of other numbers from the original vector.

Task8
Write a program that asks the user for the size of a vectorand then fills it with values.
Check if the vector is a palindrome(i.e.reads equally from left to right and right to left).
Output the result of the check.
