//Task1
//Implement a function that takes a vector of integers and returns a new vector, 
//containing only prime numbers from the original vector.

//Task2
//Write a program that asks the user for the size of a vector
//and then fills it with random numbers from 1 to 100.
//Sort the vector in descending order and display the sorted vector on the screen.

//Task3
//Implement a function that takes two vectors of integers and returns a new vector,
//containing elements that are only present in one of the vectors(excluding common elements).

//Task4
//Write a program that asks the user for the size of the vector and then fills it with values. 
//The program should then remove any repeating elements from the vectorand display the updated vector.

//Task5
//Implement a function that takes a vector of stringsand returns a new vector,
//containing only strings that start with a certain substring(specified by the user).

//Task6
//Write a program that asks the user for two vectors of numbers of the same size.
//Multiply the corresponding elements from each vectorand display the result.

//Task7
//Implement a function that takes a vector of numbersand returns a new vector,
//containing only numbers that are squares of other numbers from the original vector.
